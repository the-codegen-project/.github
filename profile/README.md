## Imagine a World Where Your Code Writes Itself

Modern development is fast-paced—and repetitive boilerplate shouldn’t slow you down. The Codegen Project CLI transforms your **AsyncAPI** (and similar standard) documents into production-ready code. Whether you're generating payload models, crafting custom generators, or automating your entire codebase setup, our CLI is your secret weapon.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Codegen CLI?

- **Effortless Code Generation:** Convert AsyncAPI, Protobuf, RAML, or OpenAPI schemas into fully functional code in minutes.
- **Customizable Output:** Tailor the generated code to your project's exact needs with flexible configuration.
- **Protocol Agnostic:** Supports MQTT, Kafka, AMQP, NATS, and more—future-proofing your development regardless of protocols you use.
- **Continuous Integration:** Regenerate code on-the-fly as your API specifications evolve, seamlessly integrating into your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Multi-Language Ready:** Starting with TypeScript, with plans to support more languages soon.

---

## 🔧 Core Features

- **Instant Payload Generation:** Automatically generate payload models, parameters, headers, messages, and even testing functions.
- **Custom Generator Creation:** Easily build your own generators directly from the configuration file.
- **Seamless Integration:** Plug Codegen CLI into any project—be it a Next.js app or an enterprise-grade microservices architecture.
- **Live Regeneration:** Keep your codebase in sync by regenerating output whenever the input changes.

## 📥 Installation

Install the CLI globally or as a development dependency using your favorite package manager:

### Using NPM
```bash
npm install --save-dev @the-codegen-project/cli
```
### Using Yarn

yarn add @the-codegen-project/cli

### Using Pnpm

pnpm add @the-codegen-project/cli

### Manually
Or download a prebuilt package directly:

```
curl -OL https://github.com/the-codegen-project/cli/releases/latest/download/codegen.x64.pkg
sudo installer -pkg codegen.x64.pkg -target /
```
For more installation options, [check our documentation](https://the-codegen-project.org/docs/getting-started#install).

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Your Project:
```
codegen init
```

This creates a configuration file where you can specify your input document, target language, and generators.

### 2. Generate Code:
```
    codegen generate
```
Watch as your models, payloads, and more are generated automatically!

### 3. Customize & Integrate: Tweak the configuration to tailor the output exactly to your needs and integrate the generated code into your project seamlessly.
